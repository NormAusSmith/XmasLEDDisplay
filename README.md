# XmasLEDDisplay

Personal project to drive a set of LED Christmas lights

The main reason for uploading this to Github was as a learning experience.

For this project I used the following:
Heltec_Wifi_Kit_32 and
BTF-LIGHTING WS2812B RGB 5050SMD from Amazon
5m long (60 leds/metre) = 300 leds


In my case I have a 263 led strip, 100 up one side of my window, 63 across
the top and the final 100 down the other side of the window, so g_LEDs[0] is
the bottom of one side and g_LEDs[262] is the bottom of the other.

Most of these effects were scavenged from the web and modified 
to suit my installation and preferences.  I'm not claiming them as my own

The following were very good resource for some of these effects
